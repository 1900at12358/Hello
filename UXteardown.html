<h1>Tear down Twitter</h1>
<h2>Questions</h2>
	<h3>1. Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.</h3>
	<div>Any one who wants to express his/her messages or wants to get information from internet. Twitter is like a information pool. You can pour water in it and get water from it, too</div>
	<h3>2. What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".</h3>
	<div>The first goal is to post messages and view others as fast as possible.</div>
	<h3>3. What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive</h3>
	<div>Fast post, the user gets wanted information</div>

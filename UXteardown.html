<h1>Tear down Twitter</h1>
<h2>Questions</h2>
	<h3>1. Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.</h3>
	<div>Any one who wants to express his/her messages or wants to get information from internet. Twitter is like a information pool. You can pour water in it and get water from it, too</div>
	<h3>2. What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".</h3>
	<div>The first goal is to post messages and view others as fast as possible.</div>
	<h3>3. What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive</h3>
	<div>Fast post, the user gets wanted information</div>
	<h3>4. What is the approximate information architecture of the site? </h3>
	<div>1st. Level: Home</div>
	<div>2nd. Level: Search, Account, Post Twitter</div>
	<div>3rd. Level: Trends, Follow user</div>
	<div>User Data: posts, follows, followers, tags, lists</div>
	<h3>5. What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?</h3>
	<div>At the home page, there are two options to get the needed information: search and the posts from following user. If it is not enough, the trends and recommended user are the options for "what to do next". This completes the goal of getting information. The home page also prvides a button to post a message quickly. This achieve the goal of posting message.</div>
	<h3>6. What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?</h3>
	<div>A navigation bar on the top serves the users. As the structure of twitter is quit flat. Users are most of time either at home page viewing posts or visit another user's profile to decide if it is worth following.</div>
	<h3>What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?</h3>
	<div>On posts: reply, retwitt, like</div>
	<div>On users: follow, twitt, block, mute, report</div>
